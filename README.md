# react-starter-kit
This is an NPM script based project skeleton which uses Webpack, SASS, ESLint, and a JavaScript framework called React.

Prerequisites
-------------
This project requires Node.js/NPM (http://www.nodejs.org) and SASS (http://sass-lang.com) to be installed prior to beginning. Once these have been installed for your operating system, clone or download/unzip this repository and then in the root directory (where package.json is found), run:

```shell
npm install
```
This will create and populate the node_modules folder. There are a lot of development dependencies, so be patient and give it a minute or two to complete.

After installation of all required libs and packages, you can run the website by invoking the `start` NPM script:

```shell
npm start -s
```
If everything is installed and configured properly, you will see a basic website in your browser. Enjoy.
